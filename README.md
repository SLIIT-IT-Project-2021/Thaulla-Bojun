Thaulla Bojun üòç

Before two three years ago, many food courts had paid their attention on offering a rich dining experience to their customers and then due to hectic lifestyle of people they initiated online food ordering using phone calls. But that was not the accurate solution for the customers due to inconvenience of having a physical copy of menu, lack of visual confirmation that the order was placed correctly and so on. According to those statistics, having an online food ordering and delivery management system in a food court would be precious factor. ‚ÄòThaulla Foods‚Äô is an online food ordering and delivery management system, which provides very sophisticated, timely and well simplified alternative for all types of dine requirements. In a nutshell, nowadays placing an order is just one click away for customers. It‚Äôs evident that customers get visually stimulated when they get an opportunity to see the entire menu by themselves. This would be an economical opportunity as well as a streamline for businesses due to having a smaller number of employers for managing customers and increase in budget. Not only for the customers, ‚ÄúThaulla Bojun‚Äù provides a comfortable environment for stock managers, delivery people, suppliers and for all the employers to fulfill their tasks in an efficient manner.
